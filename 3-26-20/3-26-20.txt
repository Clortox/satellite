Notes:
The satilite should be nearly overead, i hope that doesnt mess with it, WXtoImg doesnt 
know this flyby exists 
i guess, for this flyby the antenna's V will be facing south. I also measured antenna 
length from the center of 
the dipole

minuites before I am now realizing just how low on the horizion this flyby will be
oops i guess?

Post:
max elavation of ~8 degrees, this one is a lost cause
WXToImg didnt record anything, so there wont be any files for this flyby attached
