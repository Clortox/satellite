Notes:
This was the first try in a long time for me, I did this at my new place using my raspberry pi and needless to say it didnt work out to well. I am using gnu radio now and i dont think ive figured out how to use it to well quite yet. I seemed to be able to get slightly better quality at the price of more noise when turning up the gain settings but thats about it. I am not writing this report till 2 hours after the fact, therefore I dont have the data on the pass on hand anymore. From now on however I will be using gpredict and therefore will have better data on my passes with images. I will most likely try this again tommorow.
