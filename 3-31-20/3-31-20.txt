Notes:
We're switching to the one before, so were gonna be going out much later. Today im 
hoping there wont be any rain, but no promises. I think ill also try to setup the 
really tall antenna using a broom pole and the ladder

The antenna is now on the really tall pole, its just a matter of waiting at this point.
Its almost 7ft tall and it is daunting. Definitly not above the shed next to it but hopefully what bounces off the roof ill be able to get

Post:
This was a definite sucess! you can hear the clicks very clearly if you listen to the
audio file, check after the 4min mark for clear times, at ~6mins in you can even hear
clock tick tock! I need to rig this up better i think, put more tension on the cable cause thats creating alot of noise
