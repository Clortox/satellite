Post:
All I got was just static. there was a consistent, yet small signal at exactly 138mhz, but i dont think it was 
noaa, as dopler shift wouldnt do it that much. the azimuth changed dramatically thorughout, so it could just be 
that it was too far off, directionally
it also appeared that there was ALOT of noise going on, so much that it seemed impossible the satilite was
even there.
