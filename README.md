# Satellite

This is me attempting to rip images off of the satellites NOAA-19 and NOAA-15

All of the folders are named off of the date that the reading happened. The file with the same name is the writeup. Feel free to look through the images and watch the progress! Ill try to upload every time I do an attempt, as well as post pictures of my equipment.

All recordings of the flybys can be found in the `.wav` files. The satellite is the "tik-tok" sound playing, which most often starts 30%-40% of the way into the recording.

Here are some sample images:
