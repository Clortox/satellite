Another great flyby! Images are pretty acurate to the real thing, see the image titled

This is the second run of the day, excited to see what we get! This is the first time
I've ever tried noaa15 compared to noaa19 so this might be different, but shouldnt be
Im keeping all variables consistent to last run because Im just assuming the variable
here is the satilite

Struggled alot to get it setup, but now its working flawlessly

This was not a good run at all, alot of toruble getting the antenna started.
Once it got going though it was fine, it just really struggled to get going. Images
were not great, very blurry overall
